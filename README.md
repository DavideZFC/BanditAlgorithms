Overview

This repository contains implementations of common algorithms for the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem. The MAB problem is a classic example of the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning.

Repository Structure

classes/: Contains class definitions for various bandit algorithms and enviroments.

functions/: Includes utility functions to support the algorithms.

prova.py: A test script to demonstrate the usage of the implemented algorithms.
